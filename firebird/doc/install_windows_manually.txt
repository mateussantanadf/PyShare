Installation as a service
-------------------------

Firebird can be manually set up to run as a service in a windows
environment by executing the following steps:

  - Make sure that an existing version of Firebird is not running.

  - Unzip the archive into the new directory.

  - Set the FIREBIRD env var to point to the root of this directory.
    (It is also recommended that the FIREBIRD env var also be used in
    the PATH env var, rather than hard-coding a path.)

  - change the current directory to where files are located

  - Execute install_service.bat

  - optionally, you can copy fbclient.dll to the OS system directory.
    To do so, use the provided instclient.exe tool.


Execution as an application
---------------------------

Alternatively, Firebird can be run as an application. Most of the instructions
for installing as a service should be followed. However, you should skip the
step to run the batch file.

Firebird is run as application by executing it with the -a switch:

   fbserver.exe -a


Installation with a different service name
------------------------------------------

A feature of Firebird is the option to run multiple Firebird services
simultaneously. To do this you need to make appropriate changes to the
firebird.conf file and then run instsvc with the -name option. For example:

  instsvc install -auto -superserver -guardian -name secondservice
  instsvc start -name secondservice

The install_service.bat will do this automatically for
you. After modifying the firebird.conf file just pass the servicename as a
parameter:

  install_service.bat secondservice

NOTE: If you are running multiple Firebird services it is essential that you
do not configure the FIREBIRD environment variable at the system level.


Initializing the Security Database
----------------------------------
see README.security_database.txt for instructions.


Uninstallation
--------------

  - To remove FB you should run the uninstall_service.bat.

  - Pass the service name as a parameter if you have installed Firebird to
    use a different service name.

  - If you used instclient to deploy a library to system32 you should run

      instclient.exe remove <libname>

  - Delete installation directory. You may wish to keep the log file, security
    database, firebird.conf and databases.conf.
